npx create-react-app frontend
or
npx create-react-app . (to install in current directory)
npm start to run app
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap

Note: After installation, you'll need to import Bootstrap's CSS in your src/index.js or src/App.js file:
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
App.js:(just to test the booststrap)
import Button from "react-bootstrap/Button";

   npm install react-router-dom

   (react-router-dom is a library that allows you to implement dynamic routing in a web application. <BrowserRouter>, <Route>, <Link>, <Switch>, etc.)


NB: Now lets enable routing
  import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";,
  use it like this in index.js : 
   <BrowserRouter>
      <App />
    </BrowserRouter>
  import { Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom"; in app.js

        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </>
  );
